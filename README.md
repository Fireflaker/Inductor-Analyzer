/ Inductor-Analyzer
A long term I will be working on. Its goal is to precisely measure indicators, transformers and core materials automatically, at minimum cost, without any other test instrument..

Random stuff will be logged here. I am using this readme as a google doc.

Proof of concept: charge up a capacitor bank, dump the charge into the test subject, measure the current and view the rising edge on an oscilioscope. Analyze and culculate results manualy.

Old thoughts:
Build a DAQ, use ADC and a Raspbeyy pi/FPGA to read and keep only the useful data to send. This is bad becuase I dont want to program FPGA and they are relativly expensive.


So far:
